In design engineering, precise tolerances are essential to meet required specifications. Advancements in technology have enabled miniaturization and the manufacturing of high-precision components, such as micro gears with tolerances below 5 Î¼m. While Monte-Carlo simulations can predict inaccuracies, they are time-consuming for complex designs. These codes provide an AI-driven statistical surrogate model for a pair of industrial micro gears to predict conformity and tailored a modular cost model to interpret it into production cost.</p>
